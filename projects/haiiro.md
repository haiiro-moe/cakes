# haiiro

The page you are on is only part of what I consider haiiro. The whole project is a network of modified tools like [our safe](https://safe.haiiro.moe/), the Minecraft servers I host, or... [the group itself](https://haiiro.moe/). Asuka is also kind of part of this, but she's large enough to warrant her own place.

## The services

Our [safe](https://safe.haiiro.moe) uses a lightly modified version of the amazing [chibisafe](https://github.com/chibisafe/chibisafe), with mostly just added branding and a few small fixes for file displays. I will eventually fork some other projects for this purpose.

## The group

A heavily work-in-progress project. I'm planning to make this into a private [neocities](https://neocities.org/), and maybe get some more services running, like I said above.
