# haiiro

The page you are on is only part of what I consider haiiro. The whole project is a network of modified tools like [our safe](https://safe.haiiro.moe/), the Minecraft servers I host, or... [the group itself](https://haiiro.moe/).

## The safe

It uses a lightly modified version of the amazing [chibisafe](https://github.com/chibisafe/chibisafe), with mostly just added branding and a few small fixes for file displays.

## The group

A heavily work-in-progress project. I'm planning to make this into a private [neocities](https://neocities.org/), and maybe get some more services running.
