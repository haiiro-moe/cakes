# Cake's Minecraft modpack

A Minecraft modpack I am working on.

I don't know how much I want to share about it yet. Planning to make it very custom, with a lot of tech mods, but none of the "magic block does thing very fast" kind of mods, but the more time consuming ones that reward creativity. A full quest-line is also planned. More details when things start shaping up.

For now, the only thing that's 100% certain is custom mods (at least for something like a compatibility layer or smaller items), since I really want to learn more of Java and maybe Kotlin.
