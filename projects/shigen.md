# shigen

A very basic resource manager (for now). All it does is open an API to list system info, stop processes and shutdown/restart a PC. I don't have many plans for it, except just making it much better than it is currently. The web interface is pretty cool but still needs a lot of work. I might also add websockets in the future. The code is somewhat basic right now, since I used this project to learn a little bit about Rust.
