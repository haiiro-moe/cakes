# AniList Rescorer

A web based tool to quickly re-score your AniList anime or manga lists. It supports all scoring systems including advanced scoring. My first go at making a large-ish React project, I think it turned out pretty well.

## The tech

It's made using [React (v18.2)](https://react.dev/), [React Router (v6.2)](https://reactrouter.com/), [TailwindCSS (v3.4)](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for the looks, and [nstate](https://github.com/zaaack/nstate) for making sure the data stays consistent. Since this was my first bigger React site I have tons of things I would love to change and even more I _will_ change.
