<sup>The Linux post is still coming soon... I promise...</sup>

# I like yuri.

And I don't think I don't make it obvious, just one look at my manga list tells it all. So I had an idea at the beginning of pride month. Why not make a daily post on AniList and say a little bit about all the yuri media I really enjoyed reading/playing/watching? Amazing. One issue: I **_cannot_** hold a daily streak... The only reason I'm writing this is because I'm much better at just making one big thing than many smaller things.

Let's just get into it.

## Cakes' Ultra Tempting Elite list.

Also known as the CUTE list. I'm here all day.

By the way, If you followed my posts there will be duplicates here. Also as a quick disclaimer, all of these scores are objective. If you disagree, you are wrong. <sup>/s</sup>

### #1 - Bloom Into You

An excellent work of art. Haven't gotten bored of it since the first time, and I have re-read it at least 15 times. I love the two main dorks just a little bit, I guess. That aside, the story itself was very fun, the characters are insanely expressive with how well they are drawn, and while the environments are _somewhat_ minimal, they still convey everything well. Absolutely required read for anyone who likes yuri.

Yet another must-read. It's a very slow burn but the process and the reward are sooo worth it. Once again I have reread this one too a couple times, though not as much as Bloom Into You because of the chapter count. Ton of fun, the characters are awesome, and the resolution was really well done too.

I cried to this. I loved every single chapter. For me this manga is like OneShot, it's one of the best manga I've read. I won't recommend this as a must read, but if you like to cry **read this.** No more for this one though, I don't think I can say anything that's not a spoiler anymore.

SOO DAMN COMFY. I love this quartet a ton, they are so goofy... The manga itself is very short, so I can't really comment on it much besides that it's very cute and enjoyable to read. Definitely give this a try if you like cute girls doing cute things! Oh also, the art is really damn good.

Dorks being dorks. I really like useless lesbians, lol. I think the main reason I reread this five times was Mikoto, she's a really cute character. The side characters are also very fun, and Ren's uhh... She's Ren. I don't remember ever disliking a single character, and the manga is fun enough for me to spam reread it.

### #6 - Futaribeya: A Room for Two

One of the only yuri I actually read while it was releasing, and after _six whole years_ of me reading it, it finally ended in 2024. Ten years after its first chapter... Damn. Anyways I think it's safe to say that I wasn't disappointed one bit! The story is very average, but the characters and the art fully make up for it.

### #7 - Haru & Midori

I remember barely being able to read the first chapters because of how packed with emotion they were. The characters felt very alive, and this sense of "something's still not quite right" never really left the manga until the very last chapter. Not quite like the top manga but still very deserving of this top 10. Just as a sidenote, it's also the type of manga that I love, but will not reread anytime soon.

A very cute manga that starts off at already living together. Tons of fun, and despite the "Drama" tag its lighthearted enough for me to continue rereading it lots. _Yes, I love rereading stuff._ It's fluffy and reading about goofballs like these always puts it higher on the reread tier list for me. I know all of these are recommendations pretty much, but I still can't help but highlight some of them, this one being one such case. It's short, give it a try!

The art is extremely good. It's an ensemble cast so there are a lot of characters, and all of them are at the very least cute :D

Fluffy story with not a whole lot of story beyond the relationships of these girls. If you're into that by all means read this, it's just 50 chapters. The cover pair is probably the one I like the most, but I didn't have any complaints whatsoever about all the others. I like fluff and you shall too.

### #10 - The Two of Them Are Pretty Much Like This

No idea how I got so many 9.3/10s in my list, crazy.

This is a lengthy one. Fluff all the way from chapter 1, this manga portrays an actual adult relationship, which is kind of refreshing in a way. Finally, something that doesn't play in a school or doesn't have an overwhelming amount of angst. 104 chapters might not be short, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.

### #11 - New Game!

I LOVE NEW GAME SO MUCH. Literally the only thing that took the score down was the story, because it's not much. Everything else, the characters, the art and my enjoyment were on top. It was a little _too_ long at 183 chapters, and some of them could've been skipped or made shorter, but overall it was a treat. Not sure how yuri it is even after rereading a couple times, _but I have decided that it is._

Man the art is so cute... Yuki is also so cute... I really love catgirls, especially when they are drawn this cute. I can't say much about it other than it being very cute and really well drawn.
