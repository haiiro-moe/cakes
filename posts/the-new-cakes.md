# It's done.

The new site is pretty much complete. I have put it up on the server, pretty much all that's left
is a little bit more polish for the mobile version. I'm very proud of this one, since this is the
first time I actually try my luck with Next.js outside just playing around. DaisyUI also helped me
out a ton, since their set of components could be made to look almost exactly how I wanted them to
be, with very little tweaking.

## The style

I really like serif and monospaced fonts, so I really wanted a style where I can put in at least a
cool looking serif font. I found out that Roboto Serif has a variable font, so I instantly jumped
on it, and found out that you can modify exactly what I wanted to, the density! I was hooked.

## The process

I looked around for some inspiration, and got the gradient at the top of the pages from one of them.
Unfortunately I don't really remember which CodePen project or website it was... The entire process
starting from `bunx create` is documented on [the repo](https://github.com/haiiro-moe/cakes). Since
I wanted to do this properly I also chose to force myself to use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), which actually helped out at least a couple times when I wanted to check
back on how I did a specific thing. They did make this standard for a reason, after all.

## The challenges

**Creating an RSS feed and a sitemap:**

I wanted to put this in first thing, since my GitHub bio depends on an RSS feed, but... I'm not gonna lie
after [the mountain of production mistakes](https://safe.haiiro.moe/tDwM5NJRRDMp.png) I didn't really have
any strength left in me to make this. It's high priority. Will be done... when I regenerate my sanity.

**Creating filters for posts:**

I still haven't done this. With my current setup I don't think it would be _that_ hard, but I honestly
didn't want to make this so I put it off. It will come at a later date. And like, it's not that
important right now.

## The result

I don't like praising myself too much, but I think it came out very nicely. It's pretty much exactly
what I wanted and how I wanted it, minus the React, but I guess this will eventually work in my favor
too with the other things I have planned for this corner.

## The future

... of haiiro, and this site is the following:

-   Make some build tools for managing the members of haiiro, the group
-   Port some of my previous projects over to this style _(Mainly the rescorer, and one more that never saw the light of day.)_

Look forward to it! Also, my next post is finally going to be the Linux post I've been wanting
to write for quite some time.
